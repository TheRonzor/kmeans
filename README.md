# K-means Animation 
### (as well as an example of using the tkinter library to create a GUI)

Have mercy on me. I just started learning tkinter.

Files included:

- main.py
  - Run this script to open a GUI and run the K-means animation
  - This script also serves as a template to build your own application.  Unless you are looking to make major modifications, you do not need to worry about the other two files.

- RonsWindows.py
  - Currently contains one class, SimpleWindow().  This is bascially just a wrapper around tkinter to reduce the coding required to make a very simple user interface. Refer to the documentation inside the file for more info.
  
- kmaf.py
  - Contains the code for the k-means animation.  Refer to the documentation inside the file for more info.
